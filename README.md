Flow RL is a high-performance reinforcement learning library, combining modern deep RL algorithms with flow and diffusion models for advanced policy parameterization, planning ability or dynamics modeling. It features:
- **State-of-the-Art Algorithms and Efficiency**
  We provide JAX implementations of SOTA algorithms, such FQL, BDPO, DAC and etc;
- **Flexible Flow Architectures**
  We provide built-in support various types of flow and diffusion models, such as CNFs and DDPM;
- **Comprehensive Evaluations**
  We test the algorithms on commonly adopted benchmark and provide the results.

## üöÄ Installation & Usage
Currently FlowRL is hosted on PyPI and therefore can be installed via `pip install flowrl`. However, we recommend to clone and install the library using the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/typoverflow/flow-rl.git
cd flow-rl
pip install -e .
```

The entry files are presented in `examples/`. Please refer to the scripts in `scripts/` for how to execute the algorithms.
